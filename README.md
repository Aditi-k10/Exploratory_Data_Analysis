# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Cardiotocographic Dataset

## Project Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Cardiotocographic dataset to understand data distribution, statistical properties, and relationships between features.  
EDA is an essential step before applying machine learning models, especially in healthcare-related datasets.



## Dataset Information
- Dataset: Cardiotocographic Dataset
- Domain: Healthcare / Medical Data
- Data Type: Numerical features only
- Description: The dataset contains fetal heart rate and uterine contraction related attributes used for fetal health analysis.


## Data Cleaning and Preparation
- Loaded the dataset using Pandas
- Verified dataset structure and column names
- Checked data types of all columns
- All features were numerical, so no datatype conversion was required
- Dataset was ready for exploratory analysis



## Exploratory Data Analysis Performed

### 1. Basic Data Exploration
- Displayed the first few rows of the dataset
- Checked the shape of the dataset (rows and columns)
- Examined column names

### 2. Statistical Analysis
- Generated descriptive statistics such as:
  - Mean
  - Median
  - Standard Deviation
  - Minimum and Maximum values
- Helped understand feature ranges and variability

### 3. Univariate Analysis
- Analyzed individual feature distributions
- Used histograms to observe frequency and skewness

### 4. Bivariate Analysis
- Studied relationships between features
- Performed correlation analysis
- Visualized correlations using heatmaps

### 5. Outlier Detection
- Used boxplots to identify outliers
- Observed extreme values and data spread



## Visualization Techniques Used
- Histograms
- Boxplots
- Correlation Heatmaps



## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn


## Key Insights
- Identified important patterns and relationships between features
- Observed data distribution and variability
- Detected potential outliers
- Prepared the dataset for future machine learning models
